/*!
    @brief Initializes a channel of the PIT.

    Initializes a channel of the PIT so that it runs at the wanted frequency and mode.
    The frecuency can be somewhere between 18 Hz and 1.19 MHz, otherwise an error is returned.
    Possible modes are:
    - PIT_MODE_INT_ON_TERMINAL_COUNT: Output starts LOW. Starts counting down after reload register is set by software. 
                                      Output changes to HIGH when the terminal count is reached and stays there, until a new mode is set .
    - PIT_MODE_HARDWARE_TRIG_ONESHOT: Same as PIT_MODE_INT_ON_TERMINAL_COUNT, but counting starts when a rising edge is detected at the gate input.
    - PIT_MODE_RATE_GEN: Acts as a frequency devider. Creates a HIGH output, that drops LOW for one input signal cycle.
    - PIT_MODE_SQUARE_WAVE: Like PIT_MODE_RATE_GEN, but the output is fed into a flip flop, to produce an square wave instead of short LOW-pulses.
    - PIT_MODE_SOFTWARE_TRIG_STROBE: Software triggered delay.
    - PIT_MODE_HARDWARE_TRIG_STROBE: Hardware triggered delay.

    @param channel PIT channel to initialize.
    @param frequency Frequency the PIT should run at.
    @param mode Mode the PIT should run in.
    @returns PIT_OK on success, PIT_ERROR_FREQUENCY_OUT_OF_BOUNDS if frequency is too large / small.
